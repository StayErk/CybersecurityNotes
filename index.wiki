= Stayerk's Cybersecurity Course notes 📚 =

Hi everyone, when I started this project it was only for myself, then I realized that it might be useful from someone so I decided to publish it here. There isn't planned update hour or any kind of schedule, but I tend to update the content of this website daily as I take notes during classes. 

The content of this website is not related in any kind with any official course documentation, these are just some student's (me) notes; for this reason they can be incomplete, and/or wrong in some parts. However it is in my interest to be more precise as possible so any correction is welcome.

For contact information and for suggestion check the [[#License|license section]] or open a new issue on [[https://github.com/StayErk/CybersecurityNotes|GitHub]].

== How did I made this? ==

No complex tools have been used. I was already using [[https://vimwiki.github.io/|vimwiki]] to organize notes, I just export them in HTML and upload the here using `rsync`. For the VPS I use Vultr, if you want to try it and support me use my [[https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8718808|referral link]].
