= OPNSense Firewall Rules Explained =

In OPNSense there are three *Rule Action Types*: *Pass*, *Block* and *Reject*:

* *Pass* similar to *Accept* in `iptables` is used to allow traffic to pass;
* *Block* similar to *Drop* in `iptables` is used to silently drop the traffic;
* *Reject* drops the traffic and notify the sender with a ICMP packet.
